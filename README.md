> Advanced AI OCR & Text Analyzer
Upload an image to extract and analyze text, even from blurry or distorted sources.

## 📋 Executive Summary
This project is a web-based application that leverages AI to extract and analyze text from images. It allows users to upload images, and the application utilizes OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to identify and extract text, even from imperfect sources like blurry or distorted images. The extracted text is then presented alongside an AI-driven analysis, providing valuable insights. This tool simplifies information retrieval from images and offers a deeper understanding of the textual content.

## ✨ Key Features
- **AI-Powered OCR**: Employs an AI model through the Websim API to accurately extract text from images, including those with distortions.
- **Image Upload and Preview**: Provides a drag-and-drop interface for image uploads, with a preview to confirm the selected image.
- **Text Analysis**: Performs AI-driven analysis on the extracted text, providing insights beyond simple character recognition.
- **Asynchronous Processing with Loading State**: Uses a visual loader to indicate processing time while the AI model analyzes the image.
- **Clear Results Presentation**: Displays the extracted text and the AI analysis in separate, well-defined sections for easy interpretation.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
**Stack:** Standard Web Technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JS)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Rendering/Logic**: DOM manipulation is used to display content and handle user interactions.
- **Structure**: The code is modularized into `ocr.js`, `analyzer.js`, and `script.js` for OCR, text analysis, and main application logic, respectively. HTML provides the structure and CSS the style.

## 🚀 Deployment & Usage
1. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/advanced-ai-ocr-text-analyzer.git
   cd advanced-ai-ocr-text-analyzer
   ```
2. **Local Execution**:
   - This is a static web application. Serve the root directory using any static file server.
   ```bash
   # Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Node.js
   npx http-server .
   ```
3. **Open**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 📂 File Structure
